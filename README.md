# odin-project-html

This is my first project with the Odin Project to learn more about HTML. My previous experience was in a class, but we were told to get examples from the internet and work on SDLC instead of learning the code in depth. By the end of this I hope to do the follow:
1. Have a better idea of HTML and basic uses
2. Learn to create my own HTML website from scratch
3. Have fun learning and starting my Front-end journey
